# Introduction
This document explains how to reproduce the software-only (“golden”) pipeline for lane and road-edge detection using Python and OpenCV. It describes the environment requirements (Python version, packages, and FFmpeg), the expected repository layout, and how dashcam video is prepared as input (either as an MP4 file or as frames extracted at a fixed frame rate). It then outlines the sequence of scripts that implement the reference pipeline—region-of-interest selection, Gaussian smoothing, Canny edge detection, Hough line fitting, and lane averaging—and how each script produces artifacts used for verification. Generated outputs include per-frame diagnostics, a four-panel stage visualization, edges-only clips, side-by-side comparisons, and a lane-overlay video that serves as the golden reference for later hardware work.
